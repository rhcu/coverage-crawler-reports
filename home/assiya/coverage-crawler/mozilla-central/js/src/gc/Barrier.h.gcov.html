<span class="lineNum">      22 </span>            :  * write barrier should be invoked whenever a write can cause the set of things
<span class="lineNum">      23 </span>            :  * traced through by the GC to change. This includes:
<span class="lineNum">      24 </span>            :  *   - writes to object properties
<span class="lineNum">      25 </span>            :  *   - writes to array slots
<span class="lineNum">      26 </span>            :  *   - writes to fields like JSObject::shape_ that we trace through

<span class="lineNum">      43 </span>            :  * To understand the pre-barrier, let's consider how incremental GC works. The
<span class="lineNum">      44 </span>            :  * GC itself is divided into &quot;slices&quot;. Between each slice, JS code is allowed to
<span class="lineNum">      45 </span>            :  * run. Each slice should be short so that the user doesn't notice the
<span class="lineNum">      46 </span>            :  * interruptions. In our GC, the structure of the slices is as follows:
<span class="lineNum">      47 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      48 </span>            :  * 1. ... JS work, which leads to a request to do GC ...
<span class="lineNum">      49 </span>            :  * 2. [first GC slice, which performs all root marking and possibly more marking]
<span class="lineNum">      50 </span>            :  * 3. ... more JS work is allowed to run ...
<span class="lineNum">      51 </span>            :  * 4. [GC mark slice, which runs entirely in drainMarkStack]
<span class="lineNum">      52 </span>            :  * 5. ... more JS work ...
<span class="lineNum">      53 </span>            :  * 6. [GC mark slice, which runs entirely in drainMarkStack]
<span class="lineNum">      54 </span>            :  * 7. ... more JS work ...
<span class="lineNum">      55 </span>            :  * 8. [GC marking finishes; sweeping done non-incrementally; GC is done]
<span class="lineNum">      56 </span>            :  * 9. ... JS continues uninterrupted now that GC is finishes ...
<span class="lineNum">      57 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      58 </span>            :  * Of course, there may be a different number of slices depending on how much
<span class="lineNum">      59 </span>            :  * marking is to be done.
<span class="lineNum">      60 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      61 </span>            :  * The danger inherent in this scheme is that the JS code in steps 3, 5, and 7
<span class="lineNum">      62 </span>            :  * might change the heap in a way that causes the GC to collect an object that
<span class="lineNum">      63 </span>            :  * is actually reachable. The write barrier prevents this from happening. We use
<span class="lineNum">      64 </span>            :  * a variant of incremental GC called &quot;snapshot at the beginning.&quot; This approach
<span class="lineNum">      65 </span>            :  * guarantees the invariant that if an object is reachable in step 2, then we
<span class="lineNum">      66 </span>            :  * will mark it eventually. The name comes from the idea that we take a
<span class="lineNum">      67 </span>            :  * theoretical &quot;snapshot&quot; of all reachable objects in step 2; all objects in
<span class="lineNum">      68 </span>            :  * that snapshot should eventually be marked. (Note that the write barrier
<span class="lineNum">      69 </span>            :  * verifier code takes an actual snapshot.)
<span class="lineNum">      70 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      71 </span>            :  * The basic correctness invariant of a snapshot-at-the-beginning collector is
<span class="lineNum">      72 </span>            :  * that any object reachable at the end of the GC (step 9) must either:
<span class="lineNum">      73 </span>            :  *   (1) have been reachable at the beginning (step 2) and thus in the snapshot
<span class="lineNum">      74 </span>            :  *   (2) or must have been newly allocated, in steps 3, 5, or 7.
<span class="lineNum">      75 </span>            :  * To deal with case (2), any objects allocated during an incremental GC are
<span class="lineNum">      76 </span>            :  * automatically marked black.
<span class="lineNum">      77 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      78 </span>            :  * This strategy is actually somewhat conservative: if an object becomes
<span class="lineNum">      79 </span>            :  * unreachable between steps 2 and 8, it would be safe to collect it. We won't,
<span class="lineNum">      80 </span>            :  * mainly for simplicity. (Also, note that the snapshot is entirely
<span class="lineNum">      81 </span>            :  * theoretical. We don't actually do anything special in step 2 that we wouldn't
<span class="lineNum">      82 </span>            :  * do in a non-incremental GC.
<span class="lineNum">      83 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      84 </span>            :  * It's the pre-barrier's job to maintain the snapshot invariant. Consider the
<span class="lineNum">      85 </span>            :  * write &quot;obj-&gt;field = value&quot;. Let the prior value of obj-&gt;field be
<span class="lineNum">      86 </span>            :  * value0. Since it's possible that value0 may have been what obj-&gt;field
<span class="lineNum">      87 </span>            :  * contained in step 2, when the snapshot was taken, the barrier marks
<span class="lineNum">      88 </span>            :  * value0. Note that it only does this if we're in the middle of an incremental
<span class="lineNum">      89 </span>            :  * GC. Since this is rare, the cost of the write barrier is usually just an
<span class="lineNum">      90 </span>            :  * extra branch.
<span class="lineNum">      91 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      92 </span>            :  * In practice, we implement the pre-barrier differently based on the type of
<span class="lineNum">      93 </span>            :  * value0. E.g., see JSObject::writeBarrierPre, which is used if obj-&gt;field is
<span class="lineNum">      94 </span>            :  * a JSObject*. It takes value0 as a parameter.
<span class="lineNum">      95 </span>            :  *

<span class="lineNum">      97 </span>            :  *
<span class="lineNum">      98 </span>            :  * Incremental GC requires that weak pointers have read barriers. The problem
<span class="lineNum">      99 </span>            :  * happens when, during an incremental GC, some code reads a weak pointer and
<span class="lineNum">     100 </span>            :  * writes it somewhere on the heap that has been marked black in a previous
<span class="lineNum">     101 </span>            :  * slice. Since the weak pointer will not otherwise be marked and will be swept
<span class="lineNum">     102 </span>            :  * and finalized in the last slice, this will leave the pointer just written
<span class="lineNum">     103 </span>            :  * dangling after the GC. To solve this, we immediately mark black all weak
<span class="lineNum">     104 </span>            :  * pointers that get read between slices so that it is safe to store them in an
<span class="lineNum">     105 </span>            :  * already marked part of the heap, e.g. in Rooted.
<span class="lineNum">     106 </span>            :  *

<span class="lineNum">     109 </span>            :  * For generational GC, we want to be able to quickly collect the nursery in a
<span class="lineNum">     110 </span>            :  * minor collection.  Part of the way this is achieved is to only mark the
<span class="lineNum">     111 </span>            :  * nursery itself; tenured things, which may form the majority of the heap, are
<span class="lineNum">     112 </span>            :  * not traced through or marked.  This leads to the problem of what to do about
<span class="lineNum">     113 </span>            :  * tenured objects that have pointers into the nursery: if such things are not
<span class="lineNum">     114 </span>            :  * marked, they may be discarded while there are still live objects which
<span class="lineNum">     115 </span>            :  * reference them. The solution is to maintain information about these pointers,
<span class="lineNum">     116 </span>            :  * and mark their targets when we start a minor collection.

<span class="lineNum">     124 </span>            :  * insert it into the store buffer, which is the collector's representation of
<span class="lineNum">     125 </span>            :  * the remembered set.  This means than when we come to do a minor collection we
<span class="lineNum">     126 </span>            :  * can examine the contents of the store buffer and mark any edge targets that
